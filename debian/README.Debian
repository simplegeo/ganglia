ganglia for Debian
------------------

 Ganglia builds and runs on any Linux architecture, though it is certainly
 less tested on non x86 archs. 
 
 As of 3.0 ganglia's gmond.conf has changed format. To convert your 
 configuration use gmond -r /etc/gmond.conf and check the output does 
 what you want.
